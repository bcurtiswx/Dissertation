\section[Preconditioning]{The influence of preconditioning on MHD magnetosphericmodels} This section addresses the influence of the amount of time spent on preconditioningon magnetospheric MHD models. There are examples of previous research dealingwith magnetospheric preconditioning as described in the following section, butthe term preconditioning used here has a slightly different meaning asdescribed previously in Section \ref{InitialConditions}. In order to perform a\textit{parameter variability - sensitivity validation}, it is necessary to be able tocontrol input into the model, and for consistency, there is a necessity to keepas many of the inputs constant.\subsection{Background}\citet{Lavraud2006} performed a study on the state of the magnetosphere for asubset of coronal mass ejection and co-rotating interaction region events andlooked to identify if there was a preconditioning effect for sustained northwardinterplanetary magnetic fields (IMF). The study aimed to test a hypothesis thata cold dense plasma sheet prior to storm initiation, which is known to enhance thering current, is caused by a sustained northward IMF. The enhancement of thering current would lead to lower storm-time $D_{st}$ values. Measured andmodeled $D_{st}$ values were compared with that of a semi-empirical $D_{st}$model. The modeled $D_{st}$ tended to underestimate the actual measured $D_{st}$during events where there was a sustained northward IMF before the start of astorm. Plasma data from Los Alamos satellites were consistent with a colder anddenser plasma sheet being present for the events in which a sustained northwardIMF was present prior to storm initiation. A follow up study by\cite{Weigel2010} showed that there was no statistically significantpreconditioning effect as claimed.\citet{Juusola2013} considered how the ring current plays a role in steadymagnetospheric convection (SMC). SMC occurs when there is a balance ofreconnection rates on the dayside and in the distant tail region. This studyshowed that the ring current strength needed to be at a specific level, nohigher and no lower, in order for SMC to occur. Through a study of $B_z^{IMF}$ and$V_x$ along with the SYM-H index, \citet{Juusola2013} determined that most SMC events arepreconditioned with low $V_x$ and a slightly negative $B_z^{IMF}$, which providesenergy to the ring current and prevents bursty convection from occurring, thusallowing a continuous SMC event.\subsection{Motivation}The preconditioning described by \citet{Lavraud2006} involved the condition ofthe magnetosphere prior to a storm that would cause lower $D_{st}$ values during the storm. The preconditioningdescribed by \citet{Juusola2013} uses the term preconditioning as a set of specificconditions that must be met in order for SMC events to occur. The termpreconditioning used in these papers involves an actual state that themagnetosphere needs to be in at or prior to an event. Magnetospheric models arestarted with artificial initial conditions and then run for a certain amount oftime prior to actual or user provided data being used as boundary conditions.The preconditioning considered in this thesis involves the amount of timebetween the start of the run and the time of an event versus the state of the solar wind ormagnetospheric variables prior to an event.According to \citet{Raeder2003} and \citet{Buchner2003}, the magnetosphere willform within one hour from the start of preconditioning in a MHD simulation.According to \cite{Raeder1999}, the initial conditions for the OpenGGCM model magnetic fieldare started from the superposition of Earth's dipole with a mirror dipole thatis equally as strong, such that $B_x$ is zero in the $x = 16R_E$ plane.Sunward of $x = 16R_E$, the $B$ field in this plane is replaced by the initialsolar wind field and the run is started. \citet{Buchner2003} presented a question to thecommunity when discussing the length of preconditioning time used in magnetospheric MHD models and noted that because the magnetosphere has a long memory from previousconditions, it may take a few hours of preconditioning time to stabilizethe magnetosphere.  However,there has been no published research on the appropriate amount of time or the influence of the preconditioning time on model predictions.\subsection{Methodology}The methodology used in this section is similar to the methodology for the $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal experiment described in section\ref{SimilarMethodology}. \begin{figure}	\begin{centering}	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/PreconditionSetup.jpg}	\caption{Setup for the preconditioning experiment. Two equal length time	intervals from each run with the reversal starting at 30 minutes into the start	of the interval.}	\label{fig:PreconditionSetup}	\end{centering}	\figSpace\end{figure}To evaluate the differences between the two models with a time-shifted$B_z^{IMF}$ reversal, the output data from the two models were taken between 30minutes before the reversal to 2 hours after the reversal, as shown in Figure\ref{fig:PreconditionSetup}, and then inserted into the code that creates thedifference output, which was then processed by a Paraview Python code thatcreates images.\begin{table}\begin{center}  \caption{Input parameters for preconditioning experiment}  \begin{tabular}{| l | c | c | c | c | }    \hline    \textbf{Run Num.} & \textbf{$\rho$} [$cm^{-3}$] & \textbf{$T$} [$K$] &    \textbf{$U_x$} [$km/s$] &    \textbf{$B_z$} [$nT$]    \\    \hline     1 & 5.76 & 101289 & -442  & +3.1 to -3.0 at 00:30 \\ \hline    2 & 5.76 & 101289 & -442  & +3.1 to -3.0 at 02:00 \\ \hline  \end{tabular}  \label{table:runs12}\end{center}\end{table}As shown in Table \ref{table:runs12} for run 1, $T$, $U_x$, and $\rho$ were keptconstant throughout the entire run. The only difference between the two runs isthe time at which $B_z^{IMF}$ was reversed from a positive to negative value.This is physically meaningful as a $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal is a typical cause for enhancedmagnetospheric activity.\subsection{Results}	% B%In Figure \ref{fig:BdiffPCBeforeFlip}, the top comparison is between the earlyand late reversal runs for the OpenGGCM model. Red indicates locations wherethe early reversal has higher values, while blue indicates locations where thelate reversal has higher values. The OpenGGCM model $B_z$ output showsdifferences in the positioning of the entire magnetopause with the late reversalhaving a magnetopause that is farther Sunward. There are also differences in thecurrent sheet region with neither the early or late reversal showingconsistently higher or lower values in one specific region of the current sheet.The BATS-R-US and SWMF models show differences in the current sheet regionbetween $\pm$ 20 $R_E$ in the z direction.\begin{figure}	\centering	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/0_3/images/Bz_Diff_File1.png}		}	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/1_4/images/Bz_Diff_File1.png}		}	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/2_5/images/Bz_Diff_File1.png}		}	\caption{$B_z$ percent differences between the OpenGGCM model early and late	reversals (top), BATS-R-US early and late reversals (middle), and SWMF early	and late reversals (bottom) 25 minutes before the $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal.}	\figSpace	\label{fig:BdiffPCBeforeFlip}\end{figure}After the $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal, towards the end of the run, there are stilldifferences in the OpenGGCM model (top) run, while there are minimal to nodifferences in the BATS-R-US model (middle) and the SWMF model (bottom) run, asshown in Figure \ref{fig:BdiffPCAfterFlip}. The differences shown for the OpenGGCM model havedecreased near the magnetopause, but are still large in the current sheetregion.\begin{figure}	\centering	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/0_3/images/Bz_Diff_File26.png}		}	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/1_4/images/Bz_Diff_File26.png}		}	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/2_5/images/Bz_Diff_File26.png}		}	\caption{$B_z$ percent differences between the OpenGGCM model early and late	reversals (top), BATS-R-US early and late reversals (middle), and SWMF early	and late reversals (bottom) 60 minutes after the $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal. }	\figSpace	\label{fig:BdiffPCAfterFlip}\end{figure}% RHO%In Figure \ref{fig:rhodiffPCBeforeFlip}, the largest differences occur in thecurrent sheet regions. The OpenGGCM model differences do not extend fartailward within $\pm$10 $R_E$ in the z direction. The differences in both the BATS-R-US andSWMF models are highest in the current sheet region and extend into the distanttail within $\pm$20 $R_E$ in the z direction. In the BATS-R-US model runs, the earlyreversal has higher values in the near-Earth current sheet region. In theSWMF model, the early reversal has higher values nearest Earth outside of thecurrent sheet region. There are lower values for the late reversal in thedistant tail region.\begin{figure}	\centering	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/0_3/images/rho_Diff_File1.png}		}	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/1_4/images/rho_Diff_File1.png}		}	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/2_5/images/rho_Diff_File1.png}		}	\caption{$\rho$ percent differences between the OpenGGCM model early and late	reversals (top), BATS-R-US early and late reversals (middle), and SWMF early	and late reversals (bottom) 25 minutes before the $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal.}	\figSpace	\label{fig:rhodiffPCBeforeFlip}\end{figure}After the $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:rhodiffPCAfterFlip}, there are only small regions of differences in the OpenGGCM model (top). The SWMFmodel (bottom), and the BATS-R-US model (middle), have near zero differences.\begin{figure}	\centering	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/0_3/images/rho_Diff_File26.png}		}	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/1_4/images/rho_Diff_File26.png}		}	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/2_5/images/rho_Diff_File26.png}		}	\caption{$\rho$ percent differences between the OpenGGCM model early and late	reversals (top), BATS-R-US early and late reversals (middle), and SWMF early	and late reversals (bottom) 60 minutes after the $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal.}	\figSpace	\label{fig:rhodiffPCAfterFlip}\end{figure}% U_x%The $U_x$ plots in Figure \ref{fig:UxdiffPCBeforeFlip} show the highestdifferences in the current sheet region for all three models.No one run has higher differences in which the opposite run doesnot. The regions in which one run has higher values over the other is notconsistent. The BATS-R-US model (middle) late reversal has highest values in thecurrent sheet region. The SWMF model (bottom) has highest differences with thelate reversal run in the north and south hemispheres of the magnetosphere outside ofthe current sheet region and far from Earth, while the early reversal has higher valuesclose to Earth.\begin{figure}	\centering	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/0_3/images/Ux_Diff_File1.png}		}	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/1_4/images/Ux_Diff_File1.png}		}	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/2_5/images/Ux_Diff_File1.png}		}	\caption{$\rho$ percent differences between the OpenGGCM model early and late	reversals (top), BATS-R-US early and late reversals (middle), and SWMF early	and late reversals (bottom) 25 minutes before the $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal.}	\figSpace	\label{fig:UxdiffPCBeforeFlip}\end{figure}After the $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:UxdiffPCAfterFlip}, mostof the OpenGGCM model (top) differences are in the current sheet region. The earlyreversal has higher values tailward of -40$R_E$, while the late reversal has highervalues Earthward of -40$R_E$.\begin{figure}	\centering	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/0_3/images/Ux_Diff_File26.png}		}	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/1_4/images/Ux_Diff_File26.png}		}	\subfigure{		\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{/mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results/2_5/images/Ux_Diff_File26.png}		}	\caption{$\rho$ percent differences between the OpenGGCM model early and late	reversals (top), BATS-R-US early and late reversals (middle), and SWMF early	and late reversals (bottom) 60 minutes after the $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal.}	\figSpace	\label{fig:UxdiffPCAfterFlip}\end{figure}\subsection{Discussion and Conclusions}The differences in the magnetopause position, forall three models, are of concern to forecasters. If there is any risk ofthe magnetopause traveling farther towards Earth than geosynchronous orbit, then the companiesthat control space based technology may need to take action to protect theirequipment from plasma in the solar wind.The differences seen with all three models, for all three scalar plots, beforethe $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal, show that under northward IMF conditions, the model output depends strongly on preconditioning time. With a different output from the same model, thereis an expectation that this would change the effects that the $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal hason each model under non-artificial conditions. This preconditioning result is similar to results seen with each event validityvalidation done where each result is different because the conditions before$B_z^{IMF}$ reversals were different, as seen in a study by \citet{Juusola2013}.After the $B_z^{IMF}$ reversal, all three models had smaller differences. The BATS-R-US and SWMFmodels both show a decrease of difference to near zero percent. The OpenGGCMmodel was the exception in the current sheet region.In determining if these models had enough preconditioning, the evidence fromthis research shows a significant sensitivity to preconditioning time before the$B_z^{IMF}$ reversal and much smaller differences after the $B_z^{IMF}$reversal.\subsubsection{Summary}\begin{itemize}  \item Longer preconditioning time allowed the magnetosphere to relax more  giving different positions for the magnetopause with all three models.  \item The OpenGGCM model magnetopause position differences were larger than  that of SWMF or BATS-R-US.  \item There were large differences for all three models before the $B_z^{IMF}$  reversal.  \item The differences in the current sheet region for the OpenGGCM model were similar before and after the reversal.  \item The BATS-R-US and SWMF model differences decreased after the $B_z^{IMF}$  reversal to near zero.\end{itemize}
