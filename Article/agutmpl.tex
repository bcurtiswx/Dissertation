\section{Introduction}
Forecasting the Sun-Earth domain is difficult. The guidance provided by physics based models are inherently error prone. The predictions made of future solar events have errors. The predictions made of the heliosphere are based on the predictions made from the solar models and have errors. The predictions made of the magnetosphere and ionosphere/thermosphere are based on the predictions made from the heliospheric models. These errors grow as information propagates towards the Earth. This issue is addressed in terrestrial weather models with dense ground based measurements for model input. The cost of adding more satellites to the Sun-Earth domain is expensive thus limiting available data points.

The magnetosphere is the region surrounding the Earth consisting of the Earth's magnetic field. The data available for this region is sparse. Forecasting this region is completed today using physics-based models. These models use equations representing the physics of the region which are solved to calculate values for space weather variables in many different locations across the modeled domain.

There are multiple models of the magnetosphere and each differ greatly. Some differ by their grid choice, some differ in the assumptions made in simplifying the MHD equations. These differences are chosen with goals of comparing best to in-situ data versus other models of the same domain, thus this is the most utilized validation method.

Models are always improving as technology improvements are made yet their predictive ability is still far from high accuracy and precision. Through analysis of all aspects of the modeling process, a stronger confidence can be gained in the results from these models.

In magnetospheric models, a physical system relevant to the inputs to the model can not be initialized as there is a risk of large instabilities. Preconditioning is a process in which the equations are solved during a predetermined time period to allow the physical system it is representing to reach a steady state before input data are used. A stable set of input conditions are used in preconditioning.

According to \cite{Raeder2003} and \cite{Buchner2003}, a magnetosphere will form approximately one hour from the start of MHD simulation preconditioning. Buchner put into question that the magnetosphere has a long memory of previous conditions, it could take approximately 3 or more hours of preconditioning time to have stabilization in the magnetosphere. However, there has been no published research on the appropriate time or influences of preconditioning time on model predictions.

This paper aims to show the effects that this preconditioning time has on the errors of the differences between two model outputs from the same model. In the next section, we explain our method of testing preconditioning of multiple models through a model run web interface at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center at NASA Goddard. In section \ref{section:Results} we show the different errors produced when comparing two models through a difference validation method.

\section{Methodology}
The methodologies within this paper are a part of a larger analysis of model validation of magnetospheric MHD models (DISSERTATION CITATION). One way to view and compare multiple model outputs is through an ensemble of models. Ensemble modeling is the act of inputting the same event into multiple models and plotting all of their results together for easy comparison. The number of degrees of freedom in models can be high as the number of scalar and vector quantities change through a model run.

A different approach, with a goal of minimizing the degrees of freedom, is to use inputs that are not based off in-situ data but data that represents a magnetospheric event with minimal changes in input variable as possible. For this study, a $B_z$ reversal from positive to negative is used as input into multiple magnetospheric MHD models. The values each variable were set are shown in table \ref{table:histtable}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
  \caption{ACE solar wind measurement histogram means and $\pm$ 30\%}
  \begin{tabular}{| l | c | c | c | }
    \hline
    \textbf{Variable} & \textbf{20th Percentile} & \textbf{Mean} &
    \textbf{80th Percentile} \\
    \hline $\rho$ [$cm^{-3}$] & 2 & 5.76  & 11   \\ \hline
    $T$ [$K$] & 20554 & 101289  & 217139 \\ \hline
    $V_x$ [$km/s$] & 310 & 442 & 604 \\ \hline
    $B_z$ [$nT$] & -3.0 & 0.02 & 3.1 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{table:histtable}
\end{center}
\end{table}

To address the cost of building and compiling multiple codes for each model, as well as obtaining the computational resources required for all models, the use of a web interface that allows users to run magnetospheric models provided by the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at NASA Goddard was chosen.

To address a concern, as a part of the dissertation, a point difference validation needed model results to be interpolated onto the same grid. A second reason that the CCMC was chosen is they provide a software, called Kameleon (CITATION NEEDED) that can interpolate certain models onto a grid of choice. Specifically, the magnetospheric models chosen for this study have all been integrated into the software.

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:

% Break each line at a sign of operation

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
